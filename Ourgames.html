    <p>While have tons of items it has a 10% chance to spawn a legendary elemental boss! keep in mind that you can't get these unless you have killed everybody you have came across</p>
    <p>The bosses drops have chance of spawning the following: (25%)Fire, (25%)Water, (25%)Earth, (25%)Air, bending abilites. Keep in mind that you can't have more than one bending.  </p>
    <p>Once you beat the boss you can't fight it for a certain peirod of time being: 3 days. If you fight the boss again and you already have a bending you will either get the same bending or it will swap with a diffrent bending</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that we will be adding more bosses and areas to the game. We will also be having a vote for what area we will put in the game on 1/12/2022, be sure to place your vote! ending on 1/14/2022</p>
